This is Full Stack -challenge

The world is in dire need of software developers. We want to help breed the next generation of coders — one of our offered methods is to enroll in the Full Stack MOOC course.
The University of Helsinki and Houston Inc. have partnered up to challenge both individual developers and companies alike to learn and build upon their expertise in true Full Stack spirit. Among our affiliates and challenge initiators are Elisa Oyj, K-ryhmä, Konecranes Oyj, Terveystalo Oyj, and Unity Technologies Finland Ltd.
Our objective is to encourage learning. We offer a fully-assembled and purposefully-scoped Full Stack course that lowers the barrier of entry for learning about new state-of-the-art and production grade technologies. The course is free of charge and you can participate from anywhere at anytime, at your leisure.
The course is built by coders for coders, and offers something for both newcomers and seasoned industry veterans alike. The only prerequisite is a solid grasp of basic programming fundamentals.
